          <h2>
            🚨Caution:🚨 Potentially Risky Operation Ahead! Proceed with Care!
          </h2>

          <p>
            If you've removed some commits via the Git Bash rebase editor and
            your local repository keeps pulling them back from GitHub, here's
            how to resolve it and make your local commit log take over:
          </p>

          <h2>Step 1: Ensure You're on the Right Branch 🌿</h2>

          <p>
            First, double-check that you're on the correct branch where you want
            to apply the changes.
          </p>

          <div class="code"><p>git branch</p></div>

          <p>
            Make sure the branch you're working on is the one where you
            performed the rebase.
          </p>

          <h2>Step 2: Force Push to Update GitHub 💥</h2>

          <p>
            To make your local commit log take over the remote branch on GitHub,
            use a force push. But beware, this overwrites history, so only do
            this if you're certain.
          </p>

          <div class="code"><p>git push --force</p></div>

          <h1>
            🚨 Warning: Force pushing can overwrite remote history! Be
            absolutely sure you want to proceed! 🚨
          </h1>

          <h2>Step 3: Verify Changes on GitHub 🕵️‍♀️</h2>

          <p>
            Go to your GitHub repository and check if the unwanted commits have
            been removed and your local commit log has taken over.
          </p>

          <h2>Step 4: Synchronize with Remote 🔄</h2>

          <p>
            To ensure your local and remote branches are in sync, perform a
            regular push without the force option.
          </p>

          <div class="code"><p>git push</p></div>

          <p>
            Now your local commit log should be in control, and those unwanted
            commits should be gone from the remote repository. 🎉
          </p>

          <p>
            Remember to communicate with your team if you're working in a
            collaborative environment to avoid any conflicts. Happy coding!
