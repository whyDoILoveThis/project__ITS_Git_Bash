          <h2>🚨 Handle with Care: The Danger of Amending 🚨</h2>

          <p>
            ⚠️ When amending commits, exercise caution, especially with commits
            that have already been pushed to shared repositories. Amending
            rewrites history and can lead to conflicts for collaborators.
            Communication is key!
          </p>

          <h2>🚨Danger: Force Push Alert!🚨</h2>

          <p>
            - If the commit you amend has already been pushed to a shared
            repository, you might need to force push to update the remote
            branch. Be mindful of potential conflicts.
          </p>

          <h2>🛠️ The Git Amend Workflow 🛠️</h2>

          <p>Let's dive into a step-by-step guide with code examples:</p>

          <h3>Step 1: Make Changes</h3>

          <p>
            - Make the necessary changes to your project files. For instance, if
            you have a typo in index.html, correct it.
          </p>

          <div class="code"><p>nano index.html</p></div>

          <h3>Step 2: Stage Changes</h3>

          <p>
            - Add your changes to the staging area using <code>git add</code>.

          <div class="code"><p>git add index.html</p></div>

          <h3>Step 3: Amend Commit</h3>

          <p>
            - Now, use the <code>git commit --amend command</code> to
            incorporate the staged changes into the last commit. This also opens
            a text editor to adjust the commit message if needed.
          </p>

          <div class="code">
            <p>git commit --amend</p>
          </div>

          <h3>Step 4: Review Changes</h3>

          <p>
            - Confirm that everything is as expected by reviewing your commit
            history.
          </p>

          <div class="code"><p>git log --oneline</p></div>

          <h2>🚨 The Danger Zone: Force Push Alert! 🚨</h2>

          <p>
            - If the commit you amend has already been pushed to a shared
            repository, you might need to force push to update the remote
            branch. Be mindful of potential conflicts.
          </p>

            <h1>🔧 Git Amend: Most Recent Commit Adjustments 🚀</h1>

            <p>
              Git Amend is your trusty tool for refining your most recent Git
              commit. Here's how it works:
            </p>

            <h2>Step 1: 🛠️ Stage Your Changes</h2>
            <p>
              <b>1.</b> <strong>Stage your changes</strong> using
              <code>git add</code>. This prepares your alterations for
              incorporation into the upcoming commit.
            </p>

            <h2>Step 2: 🔄 Amend Your Commit</h2>
            <p>
              <b>2.</b> Utilize the <code>git commit --amend</code> command.
              This magic command
              <strong>merges the staged changes with your last commit</strong>,
              forging a new commit with a fresh snapshot of your project.
            </p>

            <p>
              In summary, Git Amend is your ticket to fine-tuning commit
              messages, rectifying minor errors, or inserting any missed changes
              into your latest commit. Just remember, if the commit you're
              amending has already ventured into the realm of shared
              repositories, tread carefully and ponder the potential impact on
              your fellow collaborators. 🌟🚀
