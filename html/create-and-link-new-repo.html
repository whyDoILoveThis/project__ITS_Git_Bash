              <b>Step 1: Creating a New Repository on GitHub:</b> In the steps,
              you first created a new directory on your local machine, turned it
              into a Git repository, and added your project files.
              <br />
              <b>Step 2: Linking the Local and Remote Repositories:</b> You
              linked your local Git repository to the new GitHub repository
              using the git remote add origin command. This established a
              connection between your local repository and the remote one on
              GitHub.
              <br />
              <b>Step 3: Pushing to GitHub:</b>
              Finally, you pushed the contents of your local repository to
              GitHub using git push. This action essentially uploaded your local
              project to GitHub, making it available on the remote repository.
            </p>
          </div>
          <!--~ step-->
          <h2>Step 1:üîßSetting Up Git</h2>
          <p>
            Before we start, make sure Git is installed on your system. If not,
            download and install it from
            <a href="https://git-scm.com" target="_blank">
              Git's official website.</a
            >
          </p>
          <!--~ step-->
          <h2>Step 2:üèóÔ∏èCreating a New Directory</h2>
          <p>
            Open Git Bash, navigate to the directory where you want to create
            your new project, and execute the following command to create a new
            directory:
          </p>
          <div class="code">
            <p><em class="orng">mkdir</em> YourProjectName</p>
          </div>
          <p>Replace `YourProjectName` with the actual name of your project.</p>
          <!--~ step-->
          <h2>Step 3: üîÑ Initializing a Git Repository</h2>
          <p>
            Inside your newly created directory, initialize a Git repository
            using this command:
          </p>
          <div class="code">
            <p><em class="orng">cd</em> YourProjectName git init</p>
          </div>
          <!--~ step-->
          <h2>Step 4: üìù Adding and Committing Files</h2>
          <p>
            Create some files or add existing ones to your project directory.
            Then, add them to the staging area and commit your changes:
          </p>
          <div class="code">
            <p>
              git add . git commit -m
              <em class="grn">"Initial commit"</em>
            </p>
          </div>
          <!--~ step-->
          <h2>Step 5: üåê Creating a GitHub Repository</h2>
          <p>
            Go to git <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>, log in to your
            account, and click the '+' icon in the top right corner. Select 'New
            Repository' and follow the instructions to create a new repository
            with a name and optional description.
          </p>
          <!--~ step-->
          <h2>Step 6: üîó Linking Local and Remote Repositories</h2>
          <p>
            Now, it's time to link your local Git repository with the newly
            created GitHub repository. Copy the repository URL provided by
            GitHub. In your Git Bash terminal, add the remote repository:
          </p>

          <div class="code">
            <p>git remote add origin YourGitHubRepositoryURL</p>
          </div>
          <p>Replace `YourGitHubRepositoryURL` with the URL you copied.</p>

            HTTPS vs. SSH
          </button>
          <div class="hidden btn--more-info-box">
            <p>
              <b>
                Whether you're using HTTPS or SSH, the process is similar.
                Here's a detailed explanation for both:
              </b>
            </p>
            <h2>Using HTTPS:</h2>
            <h3>Copy GitHub Repository URL üåê</h3>
            <p>
              First, go to your GitHub repository's page, click the green "Code"
              button, and make sure you have the HTTPS URL copied. It should
              look something like this:
              <b>https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepo.git.</b>
            </p>
            <h3>Linking the Remote Repository üîó</h3>
            <p>
              In your Git Bash terminal, navigate to your project directory (if
              you're not already there) and run the following command, replacing
              YourGitHubRepositoryURL with the URL you copied:
            </p>
            <div class="code">
              <p>
                git remote add origin
                https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepo.git
              </p>
            </div>
            <p>
              This command establishes a connection between your local
              repository and your GitHub repository, and it names the connection
              "origin" by convention.
            </p>
            <h2>Using SSH:</h2>
            <h3>Set Up SSH Keys on Your Local Machine üîê</h3>
            <p>
              To use SSH with GitHub, you'll need to set up SSH keys. If you
              haven't already, follow
              <a
                href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent"
                target="_blank"
                >GitHub's guide on generating an SSH key</a
              >.
            </p>
            <h3>Copy GitHub SSH Repository URL üåê</h3>
            <p>
              Similar to the HTTPS method, go to your GitHub repository's page,
              click the green "Code" button, and ensure you have the SSH URL
              copied. It should look something like this:
              <b>git@github.com:YourUsername/YourRepo.git.</b>
            </p>
            <h3>Linking the Remote Repository üîó</h3>
            <p>
              In your Git Bash terminal, navigate to your project directory (if
              you're not already there) and run the following command, replacing
              YourGitHubRepositoryURL with the SSH URL you copied:
            </p>
            <div class="code">
              <p>
                git remote add origin git@github.com:YourUsername/YourRepo.git
              </p>
            </div>
            <p>
              This command connects your local repository to your GitHub
              repository using SSH.
              <br />
              <br />
              Whether you use HTTPS or SSH, this step establishes the link
              between your local Git repository and your GitHub repository,
              enabling you to push and pull changes between them. üåüüîóüöÄ

          <button class="btn moreInfoBtn">Which to Choose?</button>
          <div class="hidden btn--more-info-box">
            <h2>üåê HTTPS vs. SSH: Which to Choose?</h2>
            <p>
              Each method has its own advantages and considerations.
              <br />
              <br />
              <b>
                Let's break down the differences and help you choose which one
                to use:
              </b>
            </p>
            <h3>HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure):</h3>
            <h3>Pros:</h3>
            <p>
              <b>1. Simplicity:</b> Setting up HTTPS is generally easier and
              requires fewer steps for most users.
              <br />
              <b>2. Universal Access:</b>It works through most firewalls and
              proxies, making it more accessible in corporate or restricted
              network environments.
              <br />
              <b>3. No SSH Key Management:</b> You don't need to manage SSH
              keys, making it user-friendly.
            </p>
            <h3>Cons:</h3>
            <p>
              <b>1. Authentication with Password:</b>
              HTTPS typically requires you to enter your GitHub username and
              password each time you interact with the remote repository. This
              can be less secure than SSH keys and less convenient.
            </p>
            <h2>SSH (Secure Shell):</h2>
            <h3>Pros:</h3>
            <p>
              <b>1. Security:</b>
              SSH is considered more secure because it uses a pair of
              cryptographic keys (public and private) for authentication. Your
              private key is stored securely on your local machine.
              <br />
              <b>2. Convenience:</b> Once set up, SSH doesn't require you to
              enter a username and password each time you interact with the
              remote repository.
              <br />
              <b>3. GitHub Actions:</b> If you plan to use GitHub Actions or
              automated scripts, SSH keys are often a better choice for secure
              authentication.
            </p>
            <h3>Cons:</h3>
            <p>
              <b> 1. Initial Setup: </b> Configuring SSH keys can be more
              involved, especially for beginners.
              <br />
              <b>2. SSH Key Management:</b> You need to manage your SSH keys,
              including generating, securing, and adding them to your GitHub
              account.
            </p>
            <h2>How to Choose:</h2>
            <p>
              <b>1. If You're New to Git:</b> If you're new to Git and just want
              to quickly start using version control with GitHub, HTTPS is a
              simpler choice.
              <br />
              <b>2. If Security Is a Priority:</b> If security is a top concern,
              or if you plan to use GitHub for sensitive projects, SSH is the
              preferred option due to its enhanced security.
              <br />
              <b> 3. GitHub Actions or Automation: </b> If you intend to set up
              automation, continuous integration, or use GitHub Actions, SSH is
              often the better choice because it doesn't require manual
              authentication.
              <br />
              <b>4. Your Comfort Level:</b> Ultimately, choose the method you're
              more comfortable with. You can always switch between HTTPS and SSH
              later if needed.
              <br />
              <br />
              <b>
                In summary, HTTPS is easier to set up and may be the right
                choice for beginners, while SSH offers higher security and
                convenience for experienced users or those with specific
                automation needs. Consider your priorities and comfort level
                when making your decision. üåüüîêüöÄ

          </div>

          <!--~ step -->
          <h2>Step 7: üöÄ Pushing to GitHub</h2>
          <p>Finally, push your local repository to GitHub:</p>
          <div class="code">
            <p>git push -u origin main</p>
          </div>
          <p>
            <b>` git push `:</b>
            This tells Git to send your local changes to a remote repository.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>` -u origin main `:</b> Let's break this down:
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>` -u `:</b> This flag is short for --set-upstream, which tells
            Git to set up a tracking relationship between your local branch
            (main) and the remote branch on GitHub.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>` origin `:</b> This is the name of the remote repository you
            linked in Step 6.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>` main `:</b> This is the name of the branch you want to push to
            on GitHub.
          </p>
          <p>
            That's it! Your local project is now a GitHub repository üéâ. You've
            created, initialized, and pushed your project with Git Bash. Bravo!
