            <!-- Firestore Advantages Section -->
            <h2>Using Firestore for Enhanced Data Management 📊</h2>

            <p>
              Firestore, a powerful database solution, offers unparalleled
              advantages for managing user profiles, comments, likes, and other
              user-centric data in your project. Let's explore how to harness
              its capabilities:
            </p>

            <!-- Structured Data Advantage -->
            <h3>Structured Data 📂</h3>
            <p>
              Firestore excels in structuring data for easy query and
              organization. Create collections and documents to represent
              diverse data types, simplifying data management.
            </p>

            <!-- Scalability Advantage -->
            <h3>Scalability 📈</h3>
            <p>
              Designed to scale with your application, Firestore handles growth
              seamlessly. It ensures optimal performance even with an expanding
              user base, making real-time features like live updates a breeze.
            </p>

            <!-- Advanced Querying Advantage -->
            <h3>Advanced Querying 🧙‍♂️</h3>
            <p>
              Firestore empowers you with robust querying abilities. Filter and
              sort data based on criteria, ideal for implementing search
              functionality, displaying comments, or showcasing liked recipes.
            </p>

            <!-- Flexibility Advantage -->
            <h3>Flexibility 🧘‍♂️</h3>
            <p>
              Beyond usernames, Firestore accommodates additional user-related
              data like profile pictures and biographies. Adapt and expand your
              data model as your application evolves.

            <h1>📂 Organizing Data in Firestore</h1>

            <p>
              In Firestore, data is organized in a hierarchical structure as
              follows:
            </p>

            <p>
              1. <strong>Collections</strong>: Collections are containers for
              organizing related documents. You can think of collections as
              similar to tables in a traditional relational database or as
              folders in a file system. Collections can contain documents and,
              optionally, other subcollections.
            </p>

            <p>
              2. <strong>Documents</strong>: Documents are individual pieces of
              data within a collection. You can think of documents as similar to
              rows in a table or as individual files in a folder. Each document
              contains fields, which are key-value pairs representing the data.
            </p>

            <p>
              3. <strong>Fields</strong>: Fields are the actual data within a
              document. Fields can hold various types of data, including
              strings, numbers, arrays, maps, and references to other documents
              or subcollections.
            </p>

            <p>
              4. <strong>Subcollections</strong>: Documents can also contain
              subcollections. This allows for a nested structure, similar to
              having collections within collections. Subcollections can contain
              their own documents, and the nesting can continue as needed.
            </p>

            <p>Here's a visual representation:</p>

            <div class="code code--file-struct">
              <p>- Collection: "recipes"</p>
              <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Document: "recipe123"</p>
              <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Field: "title" -> "Spaghetti
                Carbonara"
              </p>
              <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Field: "ingredients" -> ["Pasta",
                "Eggs", "Bacon"]
              </p>
              <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Subcollection: "comments"
              </p>
              <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Document:
                "comment456"
              </p>
              <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-
                Field: "user" -> "user789"
              </p>
              <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-
                Field: "text" -> "Delicious!"
              </p>
              <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Document:
                "comment789"
              </p>
              <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-
                Field: "user" -> "user123"
              </p>
              <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-
                Field: "text" -> "I love this recipe!"
              </p>
              <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Document: "recipe456"</p>
              <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Field: "title" ->
                "Chocolate Cake"
              </p>
              <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Field: "ingredients" ->
                ["Flour", "Sugar", "Cocoa"]
              </p>
            </div>

            <p>In the example above:</p>

            <p>- "recipes" is a collection.</p>
            <p>
              - "recipe123" and "recipe456" are documents within the "recipes"
              collection.
            </p>
            <p>
              - Each document contains fields like "title," "ingredients," and
              subcollections like "comments."
            </p>
            <p>
              - "comments" is a subcollection within each recipe document, and
              it contains its own documents representing comments.
            </p>

            <p>
              This hierarchical structure allows you to organize data
              efficiently and represent complex relationships in your
              application. You can query, retrieve, and manipulate data at any
              level of this structure to meet your application's needs.
              Firestore's flexibility in handling nested collections and
              documents is one of its strengths for structuring and querying
              data.
