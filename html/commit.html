          <h1>🚀 Making Commits and Unstaging Safely</h1>

          <p>
            Below is a detailed Git reference guide that covers staging,
            unstaging, committing, saving locally, and the differences between
            <code>reset</code> and <code>restore</code>. Additionally, we'll
            provide information about which option is safer for unstaging—<code
              >reset</code
            >
            or <code>restore</code>.
          </p>

          <h2>Step 1: 📁 Staging Files</h2>

          <p>
            <b>Staging</b> is the process of preparing changes for your next
            commit.
          </p>

          <p><b>Stage a Single File:</b></p>
          <div class="code"><p>git add filename.ext</p></div>

          <p><b>Stage All Changes:</b></p>
          <div class="code"><p>git add .</p></div>

          <h2>
            Step 2: 🔁 Unstaging with <code>reset</code> or <code>restore</code>
          </h2>

          <h2>⚠️Data Safety Consideration!🔍</h2>

          <p>
            <b>Safer Option for Unstaging:</b> While both <code>reset</code> and
            <code>restore</code> can be used for unstaging,
            <code>restore</code> is considered safer as it is designed
            specifically for unstaging changes without affecting your commit
            history. If data safety is a primary concern, lean towards using
            <code>restore</code> for unstaging operations.
          </p>

          <p><b>Unstaging</b> removes changes from the staging area.</p>

          <p>
            <b>Unstaging with <code>restore</code> (Safer Option):</b>
          </p>
          <div class="code"><p>git restore --staged filename.ext</p></div>
          <p>
            <b>Safety Note:</b> <code>restore</code> is a safer option for
            unstaging, as it focuses on the staging area without altering your
            commit history.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Unstaging with <code>reset</code> (⚠️Caution Required):</b>
          </p>
          <div class="code"><p>git reset filename.ext</p></div>
          <p>
            <b>⚠️Safety Warning:</b> <code>reset</code> can be risky as it can
            also move your branch pointer, potentially affecting your commit
            history. Use it carefully.
          </p>

          <h2>Step 3: 📝 Making Commits</h2>

          <p>
            <b>Committing</b> saves your staged changes into the Git history.
          </p>

          <div class="code">
            <p>
              git commit -m
              <em class="grn">"Your descriptive commit message here"</em>
            </p>
          </div>

          <h2>Step 4: 💾 Saving Locally (Without Pushing)</h2>

          <p>
            Your commits are saved locally in Git but not on a remote server.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>To Save Locally (Already Doing It):</b> No extra command needed!
            Your commits are automatically saved locally.
          </p>

          <h2>Important Warning! 🚨</h2>
          <p>
            Remember, your commits are safe locally, but if you lose your local
            copy, they will be gone forever! Always back up your work and
            consider pushing to a remote repository for safekeeping.
          </p>

          <h2>Optional Step: 🚀 Pushing to a Remote</h2>

          <p>
            Consider pushing your commits to a remote repository for backup and
            collaboration with others:
          </p>

          <div class="code"><p>git push origin branch_name</p></div>

          <p>
            This comprehensive Git reference guide provides detailed information
            on various Git actions and emphasizes the safer option,
            <code>restore</code>, for unstaging changes while preserving your
            commit history. Git's power is at your fingertips—use it wisely!
