          <h1 class="article__heading">🔥 Setting Up Hosting with Firebase</h1>

          <h2>Step 1: Prerequisites 🛠️</h2>

          <strong>Before you start, ensure you have the following:</strong>

          <p>- A Google account.</p>
          <p>
            - Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your computer.
          </p>
          <p>
            - A Firebase project created in the Firebase Console (<a
              href="https://console.firebase.google.com/"
              target="_blank"
              >https://console.firebase.google.com/</a
            >).
          </p>
          <h2>Step 2: Install Firebase CLI 🔌</h2>

          <p>1. Open your terminal or command prompt.</p>

          <p>
            2. Install the Firebase CLI globally by running the following
            command:
          </p>

          <div class="code">
            <p>npm install -g firebase-tools</p>
          </div>

          <p>
            3. After installation, verify that the Firebase CLI is working by
            running:
          </p>

          <div class="code">
            <p>firebase --version</p>
          </div>

          <p>This should display the installed version of the Firebase CLI.</p>

          <h2>Step 3: Log in to Firebase 🔒</h2>

          <p>1. In your terminal, run:</p>

          <div class="code">
            <p>firebase login</p>
          </div>

          <p>
            2. This will open a browser window asking you to log in with your
            Google account. After logging in, return to the terminal.
          </p>

          <p>
            3. You should see a message that you are now authenticated with
            Firebase.
          </p>

          <h2>Step 4: Initialize Firebase in Your Project 🚀</h2>

          <p>
            1. Navigate to the root folder of your web project using the
            terminal.
          </p>

          <p>2. Initialize Firebase Hosting by running:</p>

          <div class="code">
            <p>firebase init hosting</p>
          </div>

          <p>3. Follow the prompts:</p>

          <div class="code">
            <p>
              - <strong>Select a Firebase project</strong>: Choose the Firebase
              project you created earlier.
            </p>
            <p>
              -
              <strong>What do you want to use as your public directory?</strong
              >: Enter the folder that contains your web app's static files
              (e.g., <code>public</code> or <code>dist</code>).
            </p>
            <p>
              - <strong>Configure as a single-page app? (y/N)</strong>: If your
              app is a single-page app (e.g., using a frontend framework like
              React or Vue.js), you can choose "Y" to configure it as a
              single-page app. Otherwise, choose "N."
            </p>
          </div>

          <p>
            4. Firebase will create a <code>firebase.json</code> configuration
            file in your project's root folder.
          </p>

          <h2>Step 5: Deploy Your App 🚀</h2>

          <p>
            1. Build your web app if necessary. This step depends on your
            project's build tools. For example, if you're using a tool like
            Parcel, you might run:
          </p>

          <div class="code">
            <p>npm run build</p>
          </div>

          <p>2. Deploy your app to Firebase Hosting by running:</p>

          <div class="code">
            <p>firebase deploy</p>
          </div>

          <p>
            3. Firebase will upload your files to the cloud and provide you with
            a hosting URL. Your site is now live!
          </p>

          <h2>Step 6: Configure Custom Domain (Optional) 🌐</h2>

          <p>
            If you want to use a custom domain (e.g., www.yourdomain.com),
            follow these steps:
          </p>

          <p>1. In the Firebase Console, go to your project settings.</p>
          <p>2. Under the "Hosting" tab, click on "Add custom domain."</p>
          <p>
            3. Follow the instructions to verify domain ownership and set up DNS
            records with your domain registrar.
          </p>
          <p>
            4. Once verified, you can associate your custom domain with your
            Firebase Hosting site.
          </p>

          <h2>Step 7: Continuous Deployment (Optional) 🔄</h2>

          <p>
            To set up continuous deployment with services like GitHub Actions or
            CircleCI, you can create deployment scripts that automate the
            deployment process whenever you push changes to your code
            repository.
          </p>

          <h2>Step 8: Monitoring and Analytics (Optional) 📈</h2>

          <p>
            Firebase Hosting integrates seamlessly with Firebase services like
            Firebase Analytics and Firebase Performance Monitoring, allowing you
            to monitor your site's performance and user behavior.
          </p>

          <h2>Step 9: Test and Debug 🔍</h2>

          <p>
            Thoroughly test your hosted site to ensure everything works as
            expected. Firebase Hosting provides features for rolling back to
            previous versions if needed.
          </p>

          <p>
            Congratulations! You've successfully set up hosting with Firebase.
            Your web application is now live and accessible to the world.
            Continue to improve and expand your app, and consider exploring
            Firebase's other services to enhance your project further.

              <p>authDomain:"your-project-name.firebaseapp.com",</p>

              <p>};</p>
              <br />
              <p>const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);</p>
              <p>const analytics = getAnalytics(app);</p>
            </div>
            <p>
              You would need to add Firebase using the configuration (as you see
              in the code snippet) when you want to use Firebase services other
              than hosting in your web application. Firebase offers a wide range
              of services like Realtime Database, Firestore, Authentication,
              Cloud Functions, and more. To interact with these services from
              your web app, you'll need to include the Firebase SDK and
              initialize it with your Firebase project's configuration.
            </p>

            <h3>
              Here's when you should include Firebase in your web application:
            </h3>

            <p>
              1. <strong>Firebase Services</strong>: If you plan to use any
              Firebase services like Realtime Database, Firestore,
              Authentication, Cloud Storage, etc., you should include Firebase
              SDK and initialize it with your configuration. This allows your
              web application to communicate with these Firebase services.
            </p>

            <p>
              2. <strong>Authentication</strong>: If you want to implement user
              authentication using Firebase Authentication, you'll need to
              include Firebase and set it up with your Firebase project
              configuration. This enables you to handle user sign-up, sign-in,
              and other authentication-related features.
            </p>

            <p>
              3. <strong>Realtime Database or Firestore</strong>: If you're
              using Firebase's NoSQL databases (Realtime Database or Firestore)
              to store and retrieve data, you'll need to include Firebase SDK
              and configure it with your project credentials.
            </p>

            <p>
              4. <strong>Cloud Functions</strong>: If you plan to use Firebase
              Cloud Functions, you'll need to include Firebase in your functions
              code to interact with your Firebase project.
            </p>

            <p>
              5. <strong>Cloud Storage</strong>: When working with Firebase
              Cloud Storage to store and retrieve files, you'll need to include
              Firebase and configure it.
            </p>

            <p>
              6. <strong>Analytics and Performance Monitoring</strong>: If you
              want to track user analytics and monitor your app's performance
              using Firebase Analytics and Firebase Performance Monitoring,
              you'll include Firebase SDK to enable these features.
            </p>

            <p>
              In contrast, Firebase Hosting primarily handles the hosting and
              serving of your static web content (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images,
              etc.). It doesn't require you to include Firebase SDK
              initialization in your frontend code because it focuses on serving
              content rather than interacting directly with Firebase services.
              Firebase Hosting automatically uses the Firebase project
              configuration associated with your project when you deploy your
              web application, making it easier to manage and separate from your
              application logic.
            </p>

            <p>
              So, in short, you include Firebase SDK and initialize it with your
              Firebase project configuration when you need to use Firebase
              services other than just hosting in your web application.
