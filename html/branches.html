          <h1>Mastering Git Branch Navigation with Bash üöÄ</h1>

          <h2>üå± List Branches:</h2>

          <p>
            To begin, let's learn how to list all the branches in your Git
            repository. This step helps you understand which branches are
            available for you to work with.
          </p>

          <div class="code"><p>git branch</p></div>

          <p>
            This command will display a list of both local and remote branches
            in your repository.
          </p>

          <h2>üéâ Create a New Branch:</h2>

          <p>
            Creating a new branch is essential when you want to work on a new
            feature or bug fix. Replace `branch_name` with the name you desire
            for your new branch.
          </p>

          <div class="code"><p>git branch branch_name</p></div>

          <p>This command creates a new branch but does not switch to it.</p>

          <h2>üöÄ Switch to a Branch:</h2>

          <p>
            Switching between branches is a fundamental Git operation. It allows
            you to work on different tasks or features in isolation. To switch
            to an existing branch, use the checkout command.
          </p>

          <div class="code"><p>git checkout branch_name</p></div>

          <p>
            Remember to replace `branch_name` with the name of the branch you
            want to switch to.
          </p>

          <h2>üìã Create and Switch to a New Branch:</h2>

          <p>
            To streamline your workflow, you can create and switch to a new
            branch in one command using the `-b` flag.
          </p>

          <div class="code"><p>git checkout -b new_branch_name</p></div>

          <p>This is a quick way to start working on a new task.</p>

          <h2>üîç Check the Current Branch:</h2>

          <p>
            It's essential to know which branch you are currently on to avoid
            making changes in the wrong place.
          </p>

          <div class="code"><p>git branch</p></div>

          <h2>üß† Stay Up-to-Date:</h2>

          <p>
            To keep your local branch up-to-date with changes from the remote
            repository, use `git pull`. This command fetches and merges changes
            from the remote branch into your current branch:
          </p>
          <div class="code"><p>git pull origin branch_name</p></div>

          <p>
            This command will show the currently checked-out branch with an
            asterisk (*).
          </p>

          <h2>üåê Fetch Remote Branches:</h2>

          <p>
            To access branches on the remote repository, you must first fetch
            them to your local machine. This command updates your local branch
            list to include remote branches.
          </p>

          <div class="code"><p>git fetch --all</p></div>

          <h2>üîÑ Switch to a Remote Branch:</h2>

          <p>
            Sometimes, you may need to switch to a branch from the remote
            repository. This can be done using the `git checkout` command with
            the full remote branch reference:
          </p>

          <div class="code"><p>git checkout origin/branch_name</p></div>

          <p>This allows you to work on a branch from the remote repository.</p>

          <h2>üíº Push Changes to a Branch:</h2>

          <p>
            When you've made changes in your local branch and want to share them
            with others or back them up on the remote repository, use the
            following command:
          </p>

          <div class="code"><p>git push origin branch_name</p></div>

          <p>
            This command pushes your changes to the specified branch on the
            remote repository.
          </p>

          <h2>üß© Merge Branches:</h2>

          <p>
            To combine changes from one branch into another, you can use the
            merge command:
          </p>

          <div class="code"><p>git merge source_branch</p></div>

          <p>
            This command merges the changes from `source_branch` into your
            current branch.
          </p>

          <h2>‚ö°Ô∏è Rebase onto Another Branch:</h2>

          <p>
            Rebasing is an alternative to merging, which can lead to a cleaner
            project history. To rebase your current branch onto another branch:
          </p>

          <div class="code"><p>git rebase target_branch</p></div>

          <p>
            Rebasing can be especially useful when working on feature branches.
          </p>

          <h2>üå™ Resolve Conflicts:</h2>

          <p>
            In case of conflicts during a merge or rebase, don't panic! Resolve
            them by editing the conflicted files, then add and continue the
            operation:
          </p>

          <div class="code"><p>git add &lt;conflicted_files&gt;</p></div>
          <div class="code">
            <p>git rebase --continue # or git merge --continue</p>
          </div>

          <p>
            Conflicts are a natural part of collaborative work, and resolving
            them is a valuable skill.
          </p>

          <h2>‚ö†Ô∏è üßπ Delete a Branch (with caution!):</h2>

          <p>
            Deleting a branch can be irreversible, so be very careful. Only
            delete a branch when you're absolutely certain you won't need it
            anymore. Use the following command, replacing `branch_name` with the
            branch you want to delete:
          </p>
          <div class="code"><p>git branch -d branch_name</p></div>

          <p>
            Deleting a branch will discard all its changes, so use this command
            sparingly!
          </p>

          <p>
            Now, armed with these Git branch navigation commands, you're well on
            your way to becoming a Git pro! üåü Remember, practice makes perfect,
            so don't hesitate to explore and experiment with Git branches to
            enhance your skills. Happy coding! üöÄüåø
