# project__ITS_Git_Bash

9/9/2023
I thought it would be a great idea to make a website of bash commands that I constantly have to look up.
This way I will not only be learning more about building out sites, I will also have a nice quick reference guide where I know where everything is AND I'll remember more about git in the process.
This was my idea but I must confess that AI suppressed any doubts I had about it being a waste of time due to the sheer ammoumt of sites explaining git, and I likely would've dismissed the project without this advice. PhindAI assured me it was definately not a waste of time, and also pointed out that my approach has the potential of being unique.
For these reasons this project has begun.
