I thought it would be a great idea to make a website of bash commands that I constantly have to look up.

This way I will not only be learning more about building out sites, I will also have a nice quick reference guide where I know where everything is AND I'll remember more about git in the process.

This was my idea but I must confess that AI suppressed any doubts I had about it being a waste of time due to the sheer ammoumt of sites explaining git, and I likely would've dismissed the project without this advice. PhindAI assured me it was definately not a waste of time, and also pointed out that my approach has the potential of being unique.

For these reasons this project has begun.

No progress yesterday at all due to a problem with the DNS settings on my mobile hotspot causing bash err. Was 'unable to resolve host name' and I had thought for sure I did something wrong with SSH config or entered some dangerous command. But, no it was my connection the whole time. I troubleshot SSH keys for hours what a fool.

I have taken into special consideration that for this project I want my html markup to have as little classes as possible. Simpli because the project is mostly text based, and to add a class everytime I need to style my h2 seems rediculous when I could just use a descendant of an article, or info box. Perhaps I don't realize it's it obvious to do this. Perhaps it's a bad idea. Time will tell.
