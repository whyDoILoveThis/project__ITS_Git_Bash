I thought it would be a great idea to make a website of bash commands that I constantly have to look up.

This way I will not only be learning more about building out sites, I will also have a nice quick reference guide where I know where everything is AND I'll remember more about git in the process.

This was my idea but I must confess that AI suppressed any doubts I had about it being a waste of time due to the sheer ammoumt of sites explaining git, and I likely would've dismissed the project without this advice. PhindAI assured me it was definately not a waste of time, and also pointed out that my approach has the potential of being unique.

For these reasons this project has begun.

No progress yesterday at all due to a problem with the DNS settings on my mobile hotspot causing bash err. Was 'unable to resolve host name' and I had thought for sure I did something wrong with SSH config or entered some dangerous command. But, no it was my connection the whole time. I troubleshot SSH keys for hours what a fool.

I have taken into special consideration that for this project I want my html markup to have as little classes as possible. Simpli because the project is mostly text based, and to add a class everytime I need to style my h2 seems rediculous when I could just use a descendant of an article, or info box. Perhaps I don't realize it's it obvious to do this. Perhaps it's a bad idea. Time will tell.

This project is starting to evolve into a reference guide for much more than just git. I am realizing that I will have to create a bigger project that this one will tie into. At this point I am considering creating a section dedicated to git, one for firebase, and one for interactive js. 

  This has turned into my way of breaking things down in order to understand them fully. Its giving me all of the css experience I can handle and im finnaly getting deeper into modern forms of JS. I am fully invested in this project at this time while still allowing time for 'Simpli-Recipes.com', and the 'ITS-guns' project. ITS-guns is going to be tough because the next thing I have to get up and running to move foward with it is user authentication which I am still in the process of tackling.

  Its working out great that I chose element selectors and very limited classes due to the massive amount of text... Still worried that potential problems could arise, but as of now none can be forseen.

So, it's definately time to separate this into two different projects. I have started the 'Learn-React18' project/notes thing as well. 

  I used to write everything down in notebooks, but I find it better to learn this way. The best way for me to learn something foundational, or to grasp an overall concept is to write out. Draw a picture of it for my mind. I get the same experience, maybe even better doing it this way. Will finish out much of the course this way on react, also working on this, and I really need to get back to work on the recipes and guns.com clone. There is alot there to learn about authentication and APIs.
